# Sparse-Matrix-Reordering
Three reordering schemes of Sparse Matrix for better computation. Scheme 0, Scheme I (Tinney I), and Scheme II (Tinney II).
Please visit my other repository for just the power flow algorithm without any Sparse ordering techniques. 

*_It is assumed that the system has only 1 slack/generator bus._

# Note:
For now, the program only solves Newton Rhapson method whereas the fast decoupled method can be implemented easily as all of the routines are already included in this repository. For your reference, a script file has already been created. Please feel free to modify or update as necessary. I will try to update it whenever I am free.
